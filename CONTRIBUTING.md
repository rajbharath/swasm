# Contributing Guidelines

##### Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. ```TODO : Template```

##### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Before submitting, please read the Contributing guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

##### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted ```TODO: read that link ```(read more about our rationales behind this decision).

##### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Suggest your change to the contact mail and start writing code.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

##### Do you have questions about the source code?

Mail us. This project is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

##### Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.

Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
Community and behavioral expectations.
